    A reactor is said to be critical if it satisfies the following conditions:
    - The temperature is less than 800.
    - The number of neutrons emitted per second is greater than 500.
    - The product of temperature and neutrons emitted per second is less than 500000.
 
    '''
    return (temperature < 800
            and neutrons_emitted > 500
            and temperature * neutrons_emitted < 500000)
def reactor_efficiency(voltage: int, current: int,

    '''

    :param current: int
    :param theoretical_max_power: int
    :return: str one of 'green', 'orange', 'red', or 'black'
 
    Efficiency can be grouped into 4 bands:
 
    1. green  ->   80-100% efficiency
    2. orange ->   60-79% efficiency
    3. red    ->   30-59% efficiency
    4. black  ->   <30% efficient
 
    These percentage ranges are calculated as
    (generated power/ theoretical max power)*100
    where generated power = voltage * current
    '''
    generated_power = voltage * current
    efficiency = (generated_power / theoretical_max_power) * 100
    return ('green' if 80 <= efficiency
            else 'orange' if 60 <= efficiency
            else 'red' if 30 <= efficiency
            else 'black')

    - `temperature * neutrons per second` < 40% of threshold == 'LOW'
    - `temperature * neutrons per second` +/- 10% of `threshold` == 'NORMAL'
    - `temperature * neutron per second` is not in the above-stated ranges ==  'DANGER'
